<h2>About BotFusion Tech</h2>
<p>We built BotFusion Tech because we saw a huge problem: small business owners spending hours answering repetitive messages, missing leads, and juggling support with no time to grow. We knew AI could solve that — not with generic bots, but with smart systems designed for real business needs.</p>
<p>Our mission is simple: deliver automation that actually works. That means fast setup, human-level responses, and a system that pays for itself. We may be a small team, but we're obsessed with performance. And we build every bot like it’s our own business on the line.</p>
</section>
<section class="section" id="solutions">
<h2>Effortless Business Automation</h2>
<p>Every business has bottlenecks — whether it’s missed messages, wasted time on FAQs, or leads that never convert. Our AI systems are built to handle those tasks automatically, 24/7. No more missed opportunities. No more burnout. Just smooth, intelligent workflows running in the background.</p>
<p>We don’t just drop a bot on your site and wish you luck. We build and customize each one to fit your business — from local gyms and med spas to online brands and service pros. The result? More booked calls, more satisfied customers, and more time back in your day.</p>

<h2>Flexible Pricing for Unique Businesses</h2>
<p>We don’t believe in one-size-fits-all pricing. Some businesses need full-on support and deep automation. Others just need a smart bot to capture leads and answer common questions. We’ll help you figure out what’s best — and only charge for what moves the needle.</p>
<p>Most clients invest between <strong>$397–$987</strong> to get started, with ongoing support plans ranging from <strong>$197–$347/month</strong>. Everything is customized, and you’ll know exactly what you're getting before you commit.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h4>How long does it take to launch?</h4>
<p>Most clients are fully onboarded within 3–5 days. In many cases, your automation will be live on Day 1 with tweaks and optimizations ongoing.</p>

<h4>What if I’m not tech-savvy?</h4>
<p>You don’t need to be. We handle the setup, integrations, and updates. You’ll get a working system without needing to touch a line of code.</p>

<h4>Can I make changes later?</h4>
<p>Yes. All of our support plans include unlimited tweaks and revisions. Your bot evolves with your business.</p>

<h4>What makes you different?</h4>
<p>We focus on performance — not gimmicks. That means smarter bots, fast setup, and systems that save you time and close more leads. We're not here to show off tech. We're here to help you grow.</p>
